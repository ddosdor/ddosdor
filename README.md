## Hi there, I'm Sebastian

I've been working as a **Software Developer** (specifically with Javascript ) for about 7 years, and turning my own or someone else's ideas into small applications or large commercial products. My passion is creating clean and readable code , and using best practices whenever possible.

Over the past years, I've built from scratch and managed a development team of several people, with full infrastructure administration, CD/CD processes based on Gitlab and Docker, and a technology stack based on Vue.js , Typescript and Postrgesql.

Now I am looking for new challenges and work with people for whom programming is a passion

### Goal for these year

- Create blog 
- Improve my skills in UX / UI design with Figma and TailwindCSS
- Create small app with new tools like Svelte
